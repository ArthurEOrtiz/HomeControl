  This application is being devolped to learn python, mqtt communication, 
  and manage Iot Devices around my home. 

# Technology 
  - Eclipse Mosquitto 
  - Paho mqtt
  - Python 3
  - Mqtt
  - Shelly RGBW2

# Limitations 
  Since the first devices are just light controllers, I've settled on 
  using Qos>0. I dont care to hold onto the session or ask much of the 
  server or broker.
